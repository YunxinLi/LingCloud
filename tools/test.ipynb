In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?\n",
